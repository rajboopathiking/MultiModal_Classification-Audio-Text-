# MultiModal_Classification( Auto + Text)

Problem_statement :

  In this project we address the MultiModal Sentiment Anlaysis (Classification) to Archive Maximum Accuracy On Different Trannsformer Architecture. To Architecture Accuracy 98 % for MultiModal Classification (better than Many models).

Method:
  Deep Learning :
    Model 1 : MultiModal fusion Transformer(MFT)
    Model 2 : Self-Modulating Fusion Former(SMFF)
    Model 3 : Dual-Modal Attention Fusion Network (DMAFNet)
    Model 4 : Temporal Convolutional Multimodal Fusion Network(TCFMFN)
    
Evaluation:




Conclusion :
  I got this performance from my dataset. working with other dataset maybe change so please tune based your requirements.
